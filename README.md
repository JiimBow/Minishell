# MINISHELL

## Description

The purpose of this project is to re-create a shell in a simplificate form.
Instead -n for echo, no option are allowed for built-in commands.
The special characters with their fonctionnalities allowed are `|`, `<`, `>`, `<<`, `>>` and `$`.

## Instructions

Do a: `make`
Then: `./minishell`
A prompt will appear like this: `minishell> `.
Now you can enter commands like: `ls`, `pwd` ...
Use the pipe or redirection like: `echo "Hello world" | cat -e > out`.
`exit` or CTRL-D to exit the shell.


## Resources

The linux manual and ChatGPT are used for the explanation of each new external function that we never used.
Our project pipex for the pipe process in minishell.
We used the bash terminal to test the behavior of the different commands and Nda-cunh tester for check some tests that we didnt knew.
We worked partly remotely and we used Github to share and distribute the work more efficiently.
